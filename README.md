# pygame-pixelart-game
In this project I am trying to build a little Pixel-Art Game using pygame. I created a good looking background and Pixel-Art character. At the moment you can walk around with the Character and that's it, but I think for my first game ever created with Python it is pretty solid :)

### Main
* The main.py file is the only file which runs code. Here I descriptivly created everything
* If runned correctly a Pygame window will opens, where you can move the character using W, A, S, D
* The Landscape picture is the Background and the main_char picture is the cahracter I have created
* Of course you can change both, but than change also the directory to instantiate both

### Objects
* I created some objects, which you can integrate into the script, to make the game more fun
* If you want you can change the landscape if the character touches the chest or make more using the knife...
